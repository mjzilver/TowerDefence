### Map editor
- load in spritesheet
- specify types of tiles (path, grass, water, etc) 
    - properties (walkable, buildable, etc) 
    - animations 
    - locations on the spritesheet
- layering (background, path, towers, enemies)
- set waypoints for enemies pathfinding
- set spawn points for enemies
- set endgoal for enemies
- set tower build locations
- save map to file (easy to parse)
